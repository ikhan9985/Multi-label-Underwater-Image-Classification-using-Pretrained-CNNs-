Multi-label Underwater Image Classification using Pretrained CNNs 
- We used five famous pre-trained networks such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, Xception 71, and DenseNet121, on both versions of the dataset. 

## Dataset

- The dataset has two versions: the original underwater captured images and the enhanced version. We improve the enhancement of the dataset using CLAHE. You can download both versions from the link given below.
